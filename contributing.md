## Reporting issues
Feel free to report any issues you find, as long as they're not already reported. We also accept (reasonable) feedback and feature requests.

If you are providing a traceback (i.e. from the built-in error reporter), try to provide additional information about what caused the problem. Plain tracebacks are only useful in a small number of cases.

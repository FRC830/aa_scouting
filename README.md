Installation instructions
-------------------------
1. [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't have it installed already (Linux and OS X usually have Python 2 preinstalled)
2. Install Tkinter.
    * Windows: Tkinter comes with Python.
    * OS X: Tkinter comes with Python. However, if you're using 10.6 (or experience problems with Tkinter in general), you may want to [upgrade Tkinter](https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk).
    * Linux: Tkinter needs to be installed. On most Ubuntu distrubutions, the relevant package is `python-tk` for Python 2 and `python3-tk` for Python 3:
        
            sudo apt-get install python-tk
        
        For other platfoms, search your package manager's package list for Tkinter.
3. Run the program:
    * Windows: Open match_scouting_form.pyw
    * Linux/OS X: Run `python match_scouting_form.pyw` from the command line (from this folder). You can probably get your system to automatically open .pyw files with Python ("Python Launcher" on OS X does this)
